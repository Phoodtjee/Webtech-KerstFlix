                    <p>Let your heart be your guide. Just use the old one inch brush. You have to allow the paint to
                        break to make it beautiful. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas.
                        There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. Let that
                        brush dance around there and play. Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. If these
                        lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor
                        wet. Isn't that fantastic? That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. You
                        want your tree to have some character. Make it special. Now let's put some happy little clouds
                        in here. This is the way you take out your flustrations. Maybe there's a happy little bush that
                        lives right there.
                        Use your imagination, let it go. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. Let's make a
                        happy little mountain now. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. There is immense joy in just
                        watching - watching all the little creatures in nature.
                        Fluff that up. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Don't kill all your dark areas - you
                        need them to show the light. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. I sincerely wish for you
                        every possible joy life could bring. Use what you see, don't plan it. Look around, look at what
                        we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Everybody's different. Trees are
                        different. Let them all be individuals. Now then, let's play. Have fun with it. If we're gonna
                        walk though the woods, we need a little path. It's a good way of getting rid of all your
                        anxieties and hostilities. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. This is gonna be a
                        happy little seascape. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Almost everything is going to happen
                        for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. We'll play with
                        clouds today.</p>
